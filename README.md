About
=====

**wolfdosmpu** is a source mod for the original 16-bit DOS versions of Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny to add rudimentary MIDI playback support via the MPU-401 interface, replacing the OPL2-based music.

It is recommended to use this mod with [wolfmidi](https://github.com/ericvids/wolfmidi/), which converts the game's native OPL2 music data to General MIDI.

Why use this over an enhanced port like [ECWolf](http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/) (which already supports MIDI)?

Well, you _can_ use the music files generated by wolfmidi with enhanced ports that already support MIDI (I use ECWolf regularly myself)...

... BUT wolfdosmpu gives you the option to play on the original system hardware that Wolf3D is designed for, with _absolutely no gameplay changes introduced by modern source ports_ for that authentic retro 90's experience. Except it's now enhanced with MPU-401-compatible GM goodness! (Also try it on an MT-32 with Roland's GM patch!)

Optionally, you can also now play with modern controls (WASD keys for movement and mouse for turning), as well as using the TAB key to check your map collection progress (ala Quake). For those who consider this "cheating" or otherwise an inauthentic experience, a pure version with just the MPU-401 support is also available.

This mod is forked directly from the official Wolf3d source release from id Software, with only the barest minimum of changes needed to get things working. I did this as a personal exercise in DOS 80x86 assembly and 16-bit C programming. (Segmented memory is such a FAR-out concept, man!)

THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. It has been tested in emulation (via DOSBox), but since I currently don't have access to a real DOS machine from the era (with a 286 or 386 processor), I cannot yet guarantee that it works on real hardware. So please do test it and see if it works!


Version History
===============

1.31 BETA (2021-10-02)
----------------------
- Fixed Tab option setting being ignored.

1.30 BETA (2021-10-01)
----------------------
- Support for WASD-style modern controls is added. These options can be turned off in the Options menu. Alternatively, you can download a version that does not have these options at all, if you consider these "cheating".

1.25 BETA (2021-09-30)
----------------------
- Now prevents id's memory manager from messing with wolfdosmpu's buffer, increasing compatibility with AWEUTIL (the NOXMS parameter is not needed anymore) as well as EMM386 and QEMM.

1.24 BETA (2021-09-28)
----------------------
- REALLY fixed the regression this time. (Thanks to Gmlb256 for testing!)

1.23 BETA (2021-09-28)
----------------------
- Fixed a regression in MPU-401 detection code.

1.22 BETA (2021-09-27)
----------------------
- Fixed Read This support in WOLF3DRM.EXE and WOLF3DSM.EXE so that they don't shrink the view window every time (and cause a crash once in a while). This is due to the help screens taking up a lot of memory, which Wolf3D compensates for by releasing some memory used by the view window.

1.21 BETA (2021-09-26)
----------------------
- Partial compatibility with Sound Blaster AWEUTIL (MPU-401 port emulation) in DOS. The game must be started with the NOXMS parameter to prevent crashing. (Thanks to Gmlb256 for testing!)

1.20 BETA (2021-09-25)
----------------------
- Rewrote MPU code to fully reuse the existing OPL sequencer state variables for MPU playback.
- Currently testing the removal of the clear interrupt flag instruction in the inner assembly loop. Maybe that will fix issues for some hardware. Maybe not. Maybe it's worse. Please test.
- Altered .PRJ file to strip debugging symbols for better LZEXE compression. (decided after discussion with Akuma and Gmlb256)
- Replaced SIGNON.OBJ and GAMEPAL.OBJ with ones from the [Wolf3D game source recreation project](https://bitbucket.org/gamesrc-ver-recreation/wolf3d/). For the Wolf3D screen, I personally dislike the weird colors of the Activision logo, so I opted for the id logo for neutrality. :)
- Moved all the license files to the README section. I believe the general consensus is that Wolf3D's source code came under dual licenses -- limited non-commercial license and GPL). Like many other mods, I defer the option to the user.

1.10 BETA (2021-09-24)
----------------------
- Added support for Apogee registered version 1.4/1.4g by using techniques to reduce data segment usage (e.g., by allocating strings as individual characters in the code segment).
- Corrected a very rare edge case where midiTick may get executed before the length of the MIDI file has been calculated, and the song counter could potentially go out-of-bounds.
- Limited the MPU port selection in BLASTER environment variable to the range 2xx-3xx hex because poking some ports by accident can potentially kill your system!
- Changed sound options menu to display "MPU-401 (General MIDI)" instead of "AdLib/Sound Blaster". (suggested by Gmlb256)
- Added Fabrice Bellard's [LZEXE](https://bellard.org/lzexe.html) compressor in the build workflow. This is the original compressor used by id to fit the shareware game on a single floppy disk. (suggested by Gmlb256)
- Revamped build workflow to allow building the original OPL2 versions (essentially "vanilla" Wolf3D) by specifying any argument in the version selection batch files.

1.00 BETA (2021-09-22)
----------------------
- Initial release.


Usage
=====

Can I play NOW, daddy?
----------------------

Download a pre-built .EXE file for your game from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ericvids/wolfdosmpu/releases/). Drop this .EXE into your game's installation directory, e.g., C:\WOLF3D.

Also download the latest [wolfmidi.zip](https://github.com/ericvids/wolfmidi/releases/). You will need to unzip wolfmidi.zip's contents inside your game's installation directory, e.g., C:\WOLF3D. _You need to preserve the directory structure when unzipping! (Refer to your preferred zip utility's documentation for details.)_ Afterwards, your game directory should look like this:

```
  WOLF3D\
  | MUSIC\
  | | COPYPRO
  | | CORNER
  | | .
  | | .
  | | _INFO
  | AUDIOHED.WL6
  | AUDIOT.WL6
  | .
  | .
  | VSWAP.WL6
  | WOLF3D.EXE (original version)
  | WOLF3DCM.EXE (wolfdosmpu version)
```

Then simply launch the wolfdosmpu executable for your game (e.g., WOLF3DCM.EXE for Wolf3D commercial version).

In case you're wondering, the MUSIC\ directory contains all the tracks for _both_ Wolf3D and SoD games. Any tracks with the same name between each game happen to be exact byte-for-byte duplicates. If you want to save space, you may install the data files of both Wolf3D and SoD in the same directory, so they can share the same MUSIC\ directory.

Don't hurt MIDI.
----------------

Here are some tips and suggestions for some common problems:

1. If you use wolfdosmpu inside DOSBox, wolfdosmpu will sometimes play on a different MIDI device than you intended (or will not play anything at all). In this case, select your MIDI device with the help of [this guide](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Configuration:MIDI).

2. If your hardware MPU-401 is not being detected, try to set the port via the P option of the BLASTER environment variable. Try this even if you don't have a Sound Blaster card. (Some Roland MPU-401s and clones may be configured to use a different address instead of the default 330, e.g., 300, 332, etc.)

```
         SET BLASTER= ... P330 ...

example: SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T6 P330 H5
```
3. __Note on memory and TSRs__: wolfdosmpu generally requires an additional 24K more conventional RAM (estimated) than the original Wolf3D. This memory is used for MIDI file caching and parsing, and the amount needed will increase if you use longer custom songs. Be forewarned that TSRs such as AWEUTIL (which enables the necessary MPU-401 support on Sound Blaster AWE cards) will consume part of this conventional memory.

   As with other old DOS games, try to load as few TSRs as possible; for necessary TSRs such as mouse drivers and AWEUTIL, load them into the upper memory area by using LOADHIGH. You can check your available conventional memory using the MEM command.

   One tester, Gmlb256, suggests to have about 578 to 590 KB of free conventional memory when using AWEUTIL (that is, about 615 to 620 KB _before_ loading AWEUTIL; the additional usage will depend on the soundfont you use). Gmlb256 also suggests using real-mode UMB drivers such as UMBPCI if you don't want to use an EMM such as EMM386 or QEMM.

4. Apogee version 1.4/1.4g's .WL6 data files are _NOT_ compatible with WOLF3DCM.EXE; use WOLF3DRM.EXE instead. However, the data files are identical between both Apogee 1.4 and 1.4g. The main reason for keeping the Apogee version is for its "Read This" feature, which is missing in the commercial versions and is potentially useful in other mods. (Since version 1.20, I have opted to replace the publisher logo in the sign-on screen with the id logo, for all Wolf3D builds.)

5. __Note on savegames__: Savegames are NOT compatible between wolfdosmpu executables and the originals. Some savegames may load, _but don't rely on this_; there may be anomalies like missing objects or broken actor logic. id's savegame code is fully dependent on the data segment's layout, which means that any modification that introduces new global variables may/will break future savegames. (However, wolfdosmpu ensures that no additional global variables are introduced since id's original source code release, to at least facilitate adding MPU-401 support to other mods.)

Bring "M" on!
-------------

If you want to replace any track of the game with your own MIDI music, simply replace the corresponding entry in the MUSIC\ directory with a MIDI file of your choice. (Do NOT use the .MID extension. Also, do NOT touch the _INFO file unless you know what you are doing!)

However, since the MIDI files have to be optimized specifically for Wolf3D's timing algorithm, you will likely need to edit any custom MIDI files. The current limitations are:

- Only Type-0 (single-track) standard MIDI files up to 65535 bytes long are supported.
- Only one tick rate and BPM is supported: 350 ticks per quarter note (TPQN) at 120 beats per minute (BPM) -- essentially 700 ticks per second. This is because the original Wolf3D MUSE engine is locked to 700Hz. If your MIDI file does not have "350 TPQN" in its header, it will NOT play. You will need to edit it in a sequencer program to change the tick rate, and speed-up/slow-down the notes as necessary by decreasing/increasing note spacings instead of sending BPM change commands. (Tempo change is also NOT supported.) An alternative way to convert your MIDI files is to use MIDI recorder software: preset the recording to 350 TPQN and 120 BPM, and simply record the playback of an existing MIDI file.
- System-exclusive (F0, F7) and meta-event (FF) messages are currently ignored. Please remove them if possible (to save space/processing time and to avoid variable-length data issues, described below).
- Extra-long pauses, or anything necessitating more than two bytes of MIDI variable-length data (i.e., 16384+ ticks, or roughly 23+ seconds of pause between any note change) are not supported. The music will simply stop if the engine encounters this.

I am H@xx0r Incarnate!
----------------------

If you want to build the .EXE files yourself (or for some reason you love SoD's copy protection screen and its "Hitler Waltz" BGM), you will need to follow [Fabien Sanglard's guide](https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/) on how to build the Wolf3D source code on DOSBox using Borland C++ 3.1.

The version of the Wolf3D source code in wolfdosmpu has been streamlined -- it does not include unnecessary files from id Software's original source release, and it also fixes some issues with building versions other than Wolf3D commercial release 1.4 (i.e., you will not need any of Fabien's additional downloads except for the Borland compiler itself -- everything else is already in here).

In addition, helper batch files are provided to quickly switch between versions. You should execute the batch file of your preferred version inside DOSBox before launching the Borland C++ environment (BC.EXE). Then simply press F9 to build.

```
Supported versions:
_WC.BAT -- Wolf3D commercial v1.4 (id, GT and Activision/Steam releases)
_SC.BAT -- SoD commercial v1.0/v1.4 (FormGen and Activision/Steam releases)

Semi-supported versions:
_WR.BAT -- Wolf3D registered v1.4/v1.4g (Apogee releases)
_WS.BAT -- Wolf3D shareware v1.4/v1.4g (Apogee releases)
_SD.BAT -- SoD demo v1.0 (FormGen release)
```

As of version 1.10, LZEXE has been integrated into the build system. Whenever you switch between versions, an LZEXE-compressed .EXE file is generated from the last built WOLF3D.EXE in the OBJ\ subdirectory, and renamed as appropriate (e.g., WOLF3DCM.EXE, SPEARCM.EXE, etc.). If you want LZEXE compression on your current build but don't want to switch between game versions, you can run VERSION.BAT to trigger the compression routine on its own.

Also as of version 1.30, you can build the wolfdosmpu executables without modern control support by passing the "M" (mpu-only) argument to each batch file, or a completely clean version (equivalent to the original id source release, with only minimal modifications to compile SoD and the Apogee versions) by passing the "V" (vanilla) argument. You can build all 5 game versions (Wolf3D commercial, Wolf3D registered, Wolf3D shareware, SoD commercial, and SoD demo) at once by executing the _ALL.BAT file, again optionally passing either the "M" or "V" arguments.
